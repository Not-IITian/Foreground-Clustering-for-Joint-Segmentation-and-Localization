# Foreground-Clustering-for-Joint-Segmentation-and-Localization
Source code for the NIPS 2018 paper: This is the first version which replicates the results in Table 3 and Table 4 of paper. The source code is tested with Matlab 2018b on Linux 18.04.


# Dependencies
1) Quadratic Program solver such as Mosek. Please download  it from https://www.mosek.com/products/mosek/.
2) For now, I upload the precomputed feature matrices without any dependency on VL-Feat Library. However, future version of this code depends upon VLFEAT library

If you use this code, please cite our paper as well as Joulin et. al 2010 (Discriminative Clutering for image cosegmentation)CVPR 2010.
